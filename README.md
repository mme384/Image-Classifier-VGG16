# AI Programming with Python Project

This project contains the code created as partial fulfilment for Udacity's AI Programming with Python Nanodegree program.

First, train.py is developed to define a CNN VGG16 in PyTorch, trained and the network parameters stored in a checkpoint file. Second, predict.py rebuilds the model predict the class of an input image

PROJECT FILES:
- README.md                         Project README
- train.py                          Define and train the CNN
- cat_to_name.json                  json file containing the categories (predicted classes)
- predict.py                        Rebuild the model and predict the class of an input image
- batch_prediction.py               Run predict.py on a batch of images
